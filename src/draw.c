/*
 * NOTES
 *
 * This is the only file which accesses the video. Anything calling d_*
 * function should be video-independant.
 *
 * draw.c draws into a 320x200 or 0x0140x0xc8 8-bits depth frame buffer,
 * using the CGA 2 bits color codes. It is up to the video to figure out
 * how to display the frame buffer. Whatever draw.c does, does not show
 * until the screen is explicitely refreshed.
 *
 * Every object that can be painted, paints itself onto the frame buffer.
 * The underlying video layer is responsible for allocating the fb, and blitting
 * the fb to the actual screen.
 *
 * The frame buffer is 8 bits per pixels (indexed colors).
 *

 *
 * DIMENSIONS AND COORDINATES
 *
 * The frame buffer (fb) is a 320x200 i.e. 0x0140 by 0x00c8 pixles rectangle.
 * Coordinates in "fb/px" (pixels) go from 0x0000,0x0000 to 0x013f,0x00c7 and
 * therefore are U16,U16.
 *
 * The map is a 0x0100 by 0x0140 pixels rectangle that represents the active
 * game area, it is a subset of the entire map, beginning at map_frow pixels
 * from the top.
 *
 * Its width is MAP_WIDTH and it is composed of (in pixels):
 * - a hidden top, of height MAPS_TOPHEIGHT (0x40)
 * - a visible part, of height MAPS_VISHEIGHT (0x40)
 * - a hidden bottom, of height MAPS_BOTHEIGHT (0c40)
 *
 * The visible part should be centered on the frame buffer. Expressed in map/px,
 * the origin of the frame buffer is at MAPS_FB_X, MAPS_FB_Y.
 *
 * Coordinates in "map/px" (pixels) go from 0x0000,0x0000 to 0x0ff,0x013f
 * and therefore are U16,U16.
 *
 * A tile is an 8x8 pixels rectangle, a map is composed of rows of 0x20 tiles.
 *
 * Coordinates in "map/tl" (tiles) go from 0x00,0x00 to 0x1f,0x27 and therefore
 * are U8,U8.
 *
 * Entities are positionned relative to the map, with coordinates in map/px.
